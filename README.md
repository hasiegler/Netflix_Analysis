# Netflix_Analysis

### Please see the [Shiny app](https://hasiegler.shinyapps.io/netflix_analysis/).

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. 
The Shiny app in this repository can be found in the link above, which allows the user to interactively perform an EDA on Netflix movies and shows.
The Shiny app is intended to demonstrate some ways to perform an exploratory data analysis, using Netflix shows and movies as an example. 

See the file [app.R](https://github.com/hasiegler/Netflix_Analysis/blob/master/app.R) for the code used to create the Shiny app and the data manipulations.
